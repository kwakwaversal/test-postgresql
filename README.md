Test PostgreSQL features to make sure they do what you expect

# Description
Over time there have been PostgreSQL-specific features I've wanted to check.
The first one was to make sure [citext](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/citext.html)
was doing what I expect it to do. I will expand on these when and as I feel
necessary.

N.B., I am using [Perl](http://perldoc.perl.org) for testing.
